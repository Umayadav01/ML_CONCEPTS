    "**Unsupervised Learning (UL)**: In unsupervised learning, the computer explores data without explicit labels. It's like the computer discovering patterns on its own. An example is clustering similar customer preferences in an online store without telling the computer what each group represents.\n",

    "**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: In reinforcement learning, the computer learns by trial and error, getting rewards or penalties. It's like teaching a dog new tricks through treats (rewards) or withholding treats (penalties). An example is training a computer program to play a game, where it learns the best moves based on winning or losing."
